Resident Evil 2, zombies are slow-moving, persistent threats that can be defeated with headshots or incapacitated by targeting their legs. Players must decide whether to fight them to clear paths or avoid them entirely due to limited ammunition. A key strategy is using the shotgun to conserve handgun ammo and to physically separate zombies' legs to make them immobile.</p>
